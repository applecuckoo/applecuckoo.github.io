    <h1 class="emojiHeader">Colour Emoji!</h1>
    <p class="emojiText">Ah, emoji. A wonderful thing of Unicode, but one that can't stay sharp
      to the eye... until now! A new technology named COLRv1 has been invented
      by the minds at Google, and their Noto Colour Emoji font has been introduced
      to the web for the first time thanks to this marvellous technology. See for yourself!<br>
      <strong>P.S.</strong> Every year I will try and update this list with two new emojis from Unicode, make sure your browser
      is up to date so you don't miss out!
